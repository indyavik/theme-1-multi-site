/**
 * HomeContent (Client Component)
 *
 * Why this file exists:
 * - app/page.tsx is a Server Component so it can run generateMetadata and do server-only SEO fetches.
 * - PreviewProvider, SectionsRenderer and the section mapping (renderSection/filterSections)
 *   are client-side (they use hooks and pass functions). Passing functions from a Server
 *   Component to a Client Component causes Next.js errors.
 * - This file isolates all client-only logic. app/page.tsx simply renders <HomeContent />
 *   and injects SEO (title/meta/JSONâ€‘LD) on the server.
 *
 * Pattern to follow for other pages:
 * - Keep the route file (e.g., app/about-us/page.tsx) server-only for SEO.
 * - Create a matching Client Component (e.g., components/pages/AboutContent.tsx)
 *   that contains PreviewProvider + SectionsRenderer and section mapping.
