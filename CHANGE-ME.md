# Change Log (high-level)

- Added Team / Meet the Experts section (schema, default data, component, wired to home).
- Standardized array fields to object itemSchema (about credentials/badges, why-choose-us bullets, service features) and updated renders.
- Improved image editing UX: size-aware overlays and portal toolbar for small images; restored staged Publish Image flow.
- Fixed contact form: default siteSlug in payload; safe form.reset after async; better error handling.
- Corrected publish payload: overwrite only pages.[pageType].sections, flatten localized values, remove root-level sections.
